# CRCE_Social
A scoial networking platform for the teachers and students of an educational institution. Used MongoDB, Express, NodeJS, ReactJs, Redux, Redux Thunk, Socket.io and various other modules. Developed as my Internet Programming Project at Fr. CRCE, Bandra.

To run this web app on your machine: 
(You must have node and mongodb installed/running)
Run mongod.exe for the MongoDB server to be running and mongoose to be able to connect to it.

Run following commands in your terminal once you have the node environment set up.
npm install (download all dependencies and dev dependencies)
npm run dev (concurrently run server and client, this will take a few seconds, please be patient)

If the client site does not open automatically, go to localhost:3000 in your browser.
